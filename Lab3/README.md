# NLP 2: LAB 3

## You can find here our work for the lab3 which consists of 3 files:<br>
- Our work as a notebook<br>
- Our work as a script<br>
- A json file to load data that would take time to create<br>

The datasets will be downloaded automatically during the execution

(Our work was done on google colab, we invite you to use it again for your evaluation)
